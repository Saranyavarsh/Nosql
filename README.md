**STATIONARY STORE MANAGEMENT** 



This README provides an overview and explanation of the code snippet you provided. It demonstrates a basic web application example that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB as the database.


**PREREQUISITES :**

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

        MongoDB: A NoSQL database system

A web server or framework capable of handling HTTP requests (e.g., Express.js for Node.js)


**GETTING STARTED :**

Clone the repository or set up a project with the provided code.

Install the necessary dependencies. For example, if you are using Node.js and npm, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

         npm install

Set up a connection to your MongoDB database. This can be done by configuring the connection details in a separate file or directly in the code. Ensure you have the necessary credentials (e.g., host, port, username, password) to connect to your MongoDB instance.

Modify the code as needed to match your database connection settings. Look for sections of code that handle the MongoDB connection and update them accordingly.

Start the web server. Depending on your setup, you might run a command like:

         npm start

Ensure the server starts without any errors.

Access the application in your web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000).


**EXPLANATION :**

The provided code is written in HTML and uses a templating language to dynamically generate the web page content. Here's an explanation of the different parts:

**STRUCTURE OF HTML :**

The code begins with the standard HTML structure. It defines the document type, the HTML language, and includes the necessary metadata in the section.

The section contains the main content of the page.


**CREATE :**

The code checks if the edit_id variable is present. If it is, the page displays an edit form. Otherwise, it displays a create form.


**EDIT FORM :**

If the edit_id variable is present, the code displays an edit form. The form's action attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for updating a stationaryproduct with the given edit_id.


**CREATE FORM :**

If the edit_id variable is not present, the code displays a create form. The form's action attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for creating a stationaryproduct.
